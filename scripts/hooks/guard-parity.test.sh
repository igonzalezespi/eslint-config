# guard-parity.test.sh — vendored-guard integrity + liveness check
# ============================================================================
# Runs in a CONSUMING repo (and in pre-push / CI) to prove three things about
# its vendored copy of bash-guard.sh:
#
#   1. PARITY — the vendored bash-guard.sh has not diverged from the canonical
#      core in core-dev. The code is byte-identical across repos; only the
#      separate guard.policy.json differs, so bash-guard.sh must match exactly.
#   2. WIRING — the guard is actually cabled as a PreToolUse Bash hook in the
#      repo's .claude/settings.json (a perfect but un-cabled copy never runs).
#   3. LIVENESS — a known-forbidden input actually produces a deny (exit 2). A
#      byte-perfect, well-cabled guard can still be 100% inert (node missing,
#      the extractor throws) and every other check would pass green. This smoke
#      is the only one that proves the guard FIRES, closing the fail-open blind
#      spot the plugin cannot otherwise detect.
#
# Plus, ONLY when the repo has adopted the D8 phase gate (a vendored sdd-gate.sh
# is present), a 4th check: sdd-gate PARITY + WIRING (its behaviour is covered by
# the vendored sdd-gate.test.sh). Repos without the gate skip it silently.
#
# Usage: guard-parity.test.sh <path-to-canonical-bash-guard.sh> [<repo-root>]
#   <canonical>  the core-dev copy (e.g. from the installed plugin cache).
#   <repo-root>  defaults to `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`.

# --- 4. D8 phase-gate: parity + wiring (only if the repo adopted it) --------

# vendored it must keep it identical to the core AND cabled, or the gate silently
# stops governing. Skipped entirely for a repo that never adopted the gate.
# Behaviour is covered by the vendored sdd-gate.test.sh; this is the integrity +
# wiring smoke, matching what checks 1-2 do for bash-guard.
